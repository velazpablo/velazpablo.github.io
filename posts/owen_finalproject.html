<p>Cybersecurity is important in our day in age because of the steady growth of the technology in our communities. Everywhere you look, odds are is that you will see some sort of electronic that has people’s information on it such as a phone. All of these electronics have the possibility to be hacked into without the correct software or firewalls and because of these protectors it makes your information safe. Once these “protectors” are taken down it makes your information and anything that you have saved online become open to anyone. This is because once the firewalls are able to be avoided or removed the person that is trying to get in is able to access anything, they want with your personal information just because of a slight bypass of “protection.” This is where cybersecurity comes in and is able to help prevent these sorts of things from happening by staying ahead of hackers and putting hard walls down to prevent others from getting into personal information on the web.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity was first created in 1983 and it was the beginning to seeing viruses on the internet. There was no real threat back when it first started but without the start of having this security the world today would be in trouble. Throughout the years there has been an increase of hackers and all kinds of malicious people that are out to get personal information. Without the introduction to cybersecurity there would be no protection for the online information, and everyone would just be up for grabs.</p>

<p>Without the help of protection from online attacks there would be a lot of just stealing from people and companies. This means that without having this protection in place there would just a sense of the world being a free for all when it comes to things online. There would be no firewalls to stop intruders into people’s personal information. This also means that companies would not be able to make a steady growth of income. When a company goes and gets attacked by an online threat, odds are is that the threat is going for money and that is it. This is implying that if the threat attacks a company and steals money from them and then never gets the money back because the person was able to get away with it the company would just suffer losses and that’s it. This is why small companies suffer the most since they depend greatly on any sort of income they get because one attack and they can be out of business. The reason they would go out of business so easily could be because of trust between the customers and the store or just the fact that they have lost so much money that they cannot get the goods that are needed. This one reason why cybersecurity plays a big role in the everyday lives of people without even knowing.</p>

<p>Most people do not even know that attacks even happen constantly. This is mainly due to the cause of people not being informed at how much at risk you can be by not having the proper security on your online devices or accounts. There are hundreds of thousands of attacks every month and because of this everyone’s information is at risk without the help of some sort of security. Most of the attacks that happen have been proven are focused on small businesses or family run companies. This is because the company is typically not fully devolved on the security side of things because it will be focused more on income that security first. Another type of attack that happens the most are phishing attacks. These are attacks that are sent through email to make the receivers of the email give out personal information. The email is typically aimed at being a legit email but there are always links that get sent with it to get the personal information. Phishing attacks are common because they are easy to do because all they are is simple emails that get sent in hopes of having the user follow into the trap. There has also been research that says that more than half of companies admit to not being ready for a complex security attack and this is where the problem arises. More companies should be focusing on the severity of these personal attacks because if they are addressed and stopped then less people will be affected and then there would be less efforts needed to be put towards stopping these threats.</p>

<p>There needs to be more efforts towards these attacks that being put on these businesses because the amount of money and time that is being put to waste for just knowledge not being taught is the reason. If someone is creating a company, they should have done research and be informed on these attacks that could happen even if they do not happen at first. Threats can happen at any point and that is the problem with not being informed or prepared to defend against them. There have been studies that by 2021 the amount of money that is put towards global cost of online crime is going to hit six trillion dollars. In 2015 the cost was more around three trillion. Yes, having good security is hard to have without paying for it but in the long run it will be worth it because that means there has to be less time and money spent trying to recover from an attack that hacked into your company and took information and money.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity is important because everyone is using technology, and this makes the online world have threats to personal information. When the threats are stopped this will make businesses and everyday life become easier. This is why cybersecurity plays such a big role in our communities because without it there would just be identity fraud and personal information being taken constantly.</p>
