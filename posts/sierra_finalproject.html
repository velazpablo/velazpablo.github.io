<p>Computers are used every day and are always advancing; many people don’t really know how a computer works or the components inside. The computer has many components that allows it to operate, prosses, and store data. The computer is composed of the IPOS cycle, form factors, motherboard, software applications, digital devices, and the digital device options. IPOS help the computer run and process data, the motherboard is where everything connects, and form factors help us identify the type of computer. Computers have been around for decades; the first programmable computer was created by Konrad Zuse in 1936 and 1938 and it was called the Z1 (Zimmermann). There have been many other designs of computers that got us to the computers we have today.</p>

  <p><i>Computer Component 1.</i> The first component of the computer is the IPOS cycle which stands for input, processing, output, and storage. Input is where the data is being obtained by the user and is being transported to the components in the computer. The processing starts taking place, the step often performs math and other operations in order to process the data that is given by the user. Output is when the computer takes the information that is stored in the computer and is given to the user. The output are the results of the input data being processed (Price). Storage is the last step of the IPOS cycle, this is where the data lies and is kept in a form of memory such as RAM a main memory or a short- term memory such as cache. Integrated circuits also help the IPOS cycle, they can be devoted to a task such as collecting input, processing, output, or storage. An integrated circuit is an electronic circuitry etched on a base of silicon to form a microchip. These circuits are referred to computer chip or microchips. 
  
  <p><i>Computer Component 2.</i> The next component of the computer is the form factors, these are the computers figurations of the system unit. There are three types of form factors, clamshell, slate, and component. A clamshell device has a hinge that is used to open a screen and contains a keyboard for the base and a screen (What is a Form Factor? n.d.). An example of a clamshell device is a laptop, they contain a screen, keyboard, touchpad, on/off buttons, etc. Another example is a flip phone, it uses, it uses a hinge to open, contains a screen, and a keyboard for the user to input data into the device. Another form factor is slate, these devices have a touch screen and displays a virtual keyboard to allow users to input data virtually on the device. An example of a slate device is an iPhone, they have a touch screen, home button, virtual keyboard, speaker, microphone, etc. The last form factor is the component system there are your desktop computers. Component devise are composed of various parts such as a display unit, system unit, and keyboard. This kind of form factor is less popular today because of all the components needed to set up. Form factors are an important component to computers because it allows us to build different types of computers such as phones, we take everywhere to desktops we use at work.</p> 

  <p><i>Computer Component 3.</i> The motherboard is another componet to the computer that is very important. The first motherboard was used in the IDM Personal Computer that was released in the 1981, at the time they called the motherboard the “planar” (Computer Hope). The motherboard is a circuit board in the computer and is the main board which all the components connect to (What is a Motherboard? 2019). The CPU, central processing unit is also connected to the motherboard and contains microprocessors that are a core function to the CPU. A processer is placed into a secure CPU socket on the motherboard. Since processor produce a lot of heat, they are covered in a heat sink to keep them cool and not burn up. A heat sink is a device that contains a fan or sometime of means to keep the hot component cool (Computer Hope). The CPU is referred to as the brain of the computer and handles all instructions that it receives from hardware and software running on the computer. The slots on the motherboard indicate the type of RAM, stored information that is waiting to be used and helps make the computer fast and process. RAM stands for random-access memory and requires power to keep the data accessible (Martindale). Drives are also connected to the motherboard and are used to store data when it’s not being used (Computer Hope). Overall computers need a lot of components to operate and if they don’t have the IPOS cycle they can’t process or store data.</p>

   <p><i>Computer Component 4.</i> The next component of the computer is the software that can be downloaded or that are already on the computer. There are three types of software; application, system, and development tools, this software allows the computer to do many tasks. Application software is also referred to as an app, you typically download them, and they help carry out a task. An example of application software would be Microsoft word documents to write papers, music applications such as Spotify, or excel spreadsheets to help keep track of data (New Perspectives Microsoft Office). System software is an operating system or a utility software that helps the computer carry out operating tasks. Some examples of system software are operating systems, CPU monitor, and device drivers. Operating systems (OS) is the master controller for the activities that are taking place in the computer. The OS controls the use of hardware resources such as memory and disk storage space. Development tools are used for creating software application such as web sites and operating systems (New Perspectives Microsoft Office). Some examples of development tools are programing languages, scripting languages, and debugging tools. Without software we would have nothing to run on our computer or work on projects to help better computers and applications today.</p>

   <p><i>Computer Component 5.</i> The last computer component are the digital devices there are two categories; Enterprise Computers and Personal Computers. Enterprise computers are supercomputers, mainframes, and servers which are some of today’s most powerful computers. Supercomputers is a very fast computer one of the fastest in the world and because of the high speeds they can take on complex tasks that is not practical for other computers. Supercomputers are used for breaking codes and simulating nuclear explosions, all stuff that doesn’t happen on your at home laptop. Companies such as IBM and China’s NRCPC are known to have the world’s fastest computer (New Perspectives Microsoft Office). A mainframe computer is a large and expensive computer that can process data for hundreds of thousands of users. Mainframes are used by businesses and government agencies to provide processing and storage for very large amounts of data. An example would be a bank, they use these types of computers in order to ensure data security, these types of computers can cost up to $1 million (New Perspectives Microsoft Office). Servers are the last part of the enterprise computers, servers aid data to computers that are connected to a network. When looking up information on the internet such as Google the information that is being provided is from a server. Some examples of applications being supported by a server is email, Skype, and online games. Most computers can operate a server but manufactures computers build servers to store and distribute data to networks (New Perspectives Microsoft Office). Personal computers consist of desktop computer, portables, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. Desktops are a personal computer that fits right on your desk and is powered from an electrical wall outlet. The keyboard is separate and is connected by a cable, there is also a mouse that sits on your desk that connects to the computer. Desktops are typically used in offices and schools where there is no need to transport the computer around (New Perspectives Microsoft Office). Portable computers run on a battery they contain a screen, keyboard, camera, storage devices, and speakers. This allows users to transport this computer wherever it needs to be. Examples of portable computers are laptops, smartphones, and tablets. A Chromebook is a special kind of laptop because rather than storing data on the laptop itself it stores data in the cloud. They have a clamshell form factor and look very much like a laptop (New Perspectives Microsoft Office). Another personal computer is a tablet, a portable computer with a touch screen that can be used from input and outputs. These tablets use special operating systems such as IOS or Windows 10. There is also a slate version that has a touch screen buy no physical keyboard, an example of this would be an iPad or Samsung Galaxy Tab. These are 2-in-1 operating systems they act like a computer but are a tablet because of the lack of a keyboard. The last personal computer is a smartphone which is very similar to tablets but has cellular communication abilities so they can make calls and texts. Smartphones run on a battery, have a small virtual keyboard/touchscreen, and is made to take everywhere and fit in your pocket (New Perspectives Microsoft Office). There are many types of computers and is important to understand each kind because people use computers every day and they are just evolving as we speak. </p>

   <p>Technology is taking over the world, today we are developing new was to communicate and achieve our goals. Computers are used in our everyday lives, in the classroom or at the office we use technology to help us learn and to develop more for the next computers. Learning and understanding the components and device types is very important so users can get their full potential out of them. Computers are composed of many parts such as the motherboard, CPU, IPOS cycle, operating systems, and their form factor. Today everyone has an iPhone and laptop or tablet and is used every day for life and work. Learning about computers is crucial to life because they are going nowhere.</p>
