<p><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p>At the beginning of time, starting with cavemen, humans had to rely on natural means of accomplishing tasks but after the invention of electricity, inventors began to explore how to increase human productivity. The expansion and development of technology made it possible for users to remotely do things such as &ldquo;cool our homes on a hot summer day&rdquo; (History of Electricity, n.d.) from electronic devices. One of the firsts tasks that humans tried to master was communication which archaeologists saw with cave paintings as the first means of presenting messages. As time passed people wanted to find means of doing this across long distances. This led to the invention of the telegraph by Samuel B.F. Morse, along with the widely known input system known as Morse code (Stern, 2020). The creation of the telegraph eventually led to the discovery of the telephone which then developed into mobile devices. Morse code was one of the first input-output systems where a specific orders of dots, lines, and spaces represented specific characters (Morse Code, 2019). This later developed into the input-output system that many computer processing units (CPUs) use known as the binary system. Binary code, unlike Morse code, uses a system of zeros and ones as input to represent data. This code serves as the base for file creation which is the foundation for the Internet and CPUs for the design of HTML files and software. This data is not only vulnerable due to the connections people have with the digital world but it is also unsafe because of the security measures that aren&rsquo;t put in place on the systems that people use. It is for this reason that cybersecurity is very important to the well-being of people&rsquo;s lives.</p>

<p>Cybersecurity is defined by Merriam Webster as the &ldquo;methods taken to protect a computer or system against unauthorized access or an attack&rdquo; (Rossouw von Solms, 2013).This access and these attacks are carried out to inflict harm on a user, violate their data, or cause damage to a system. For these reasons&rsquo; cybersecurity is essential to protect users' digital data. This is such a priority, that over 50 nations have an official plan for strategizing cybersecurity threats&#8239;(Rossouw von Solms, 2013). Not only do these measures include the protection of a system or a users' data, but it also includes the &ldquo;tools, policies, security safeguards, risk management approaches, actions and technologies that protect the cyber environment&rdquo; (Rossouw von Solms, 2013). These practices help ensure that private data such as people's Date of Birth and Social Security, or other information as simple as someone&rsquo;s address, isn&rsquo;t in the hands of someone with malicious intent. As the use of technology as a means of accomplishing tasks expands the quantity of personal data that is stored online grows as well. This is why the data that is collected must be kept safe so that when technology is incorporated into tasks, such as running and driving, users are kept safe and their information is too. When stakeholder&rsquo;s digital data isn&rsquo;t stored safely this puts them at risk for issues such as identity theft, ransom, cyber-attacks and large-scale occurrences such as cyber warfare.</p>

<p>The cyber-world is meaningless without any promise of the protection user&rsquo;s digital data and the privacy of their information. The Saint Leo core value of integrity upholds this concept since moral principles play a huge role in how we use computer systems. Integrity is essentially focused on the strength and value of one&rsquo;s moral principles (Integrity, n.d.). Often people do not embody this and make the choice to steal or violate others information and their systems. Cybersecurity aims to diminish this threat and ensure that the integrity of people&rsquo;s data is valid and credible. One way we see this in real life is through the web source known as Turnitin&copy;. This website searches papers, articles, and journals for information that is identical to ensure the academic integrity of submitted papers. The protection of data in this form is also seen when cybersecurity, measures such as antivirus software, do searches to ensure the integrity of the information that is received and shared by a system.</p>

<br>
<p><b>Background</b></p>

<p>To understand the growing role of technology in the daily habits of human beings there must be an understanding of where this relationship began. Computer systems are understood based on their complexity or what is more specifically known as their generation. First-generation systems were primarily input-output systems that could do one calculation at a time and store small amounts of memory hence why they took up a lot of space (Burns, 2016). Even though these systems were very spacious, expensive, and inefficient, they improved productivity by increasing how fast computations could be completed (Generations of Computer, 2019). Subsequently was the creation of the second generation which was faster, cheaper, and led to the use of the binary system which allowed for instructions to be stored easier (Burns, 2016). These improvements also meant that more maintenance was needed hence why the development of the third generation was seen after this six-year period (Generations of Computer, 2019). As the generations progressed, the goal of making them more portable was still a priority hence why transistors were becoming smaller thus increasing their efficiency. This also extended to the use of external input devices such as keyboards or output devices such as monitors (Burns, 2016). These devices were also now capable of multitasking which was a huge advantage compared to the slow efficiency of the two former generations. The fourth generation is one of the most popular in the twenty-first century. One of the primary reasons for this is because they allow us to connect to something special, networks (Burns, 2016). A huge drawback of the advantage that such connections have is the security, privacy, and safety of the information transmitted through these signals. These signals can be intercepted and manipulated against the wishes of the user. As fifth-generation computing expands, which explores artificial intelligence and response to real-life situations (Generations of Computer, 2019), concerns arise regarding issues that were never solved in the development of the fourth generation. The use of networks is not as safe as people assume and many use it without any protections or safeguards for their data. The fear that these practices may extend into the use of fifth-generation technology is a heavy concern. This use of information systems has introduced complex technology into basic tasks such as driving by allowing Wi-Fi connections in an automobile or vehicles to make decisions at a natural rate. It has also made playing video games more complex by allowing users to place themselves in virtual simulations (Computer - Fifth Generation, n.d.). The introduction of fifth-generation technology into the business world is known as virtualization, but there are considerable advantages and disadvantages of such a process. Doing such increases the efficiency of productivity since less maintenance on a physical server is needed but managing who has access to servers and upholding data integrity isn&rsquo;t simple (Fifth Generation Computing: Virtualization And How To Manage It, 2018).</p>

<p>Not only is an understanding of how computer systems have had an increasingly infiltrated role in the lives of people essential, but knowing how these systems work is also necessary to assess how to use them safely. One key component of a computer is the central processing unit (CPU) which processes the instructions or input given to a system to demonstrate the desired output (Bethea, 2019). The CPU is worthless without an engine to power it, or a motherboard more specifically. The motherboard contains all the circuits which transfer the information from the input devices, store the information, or display the output (Bethea, 2019). Another key component in how computer systems function includes the processing of information which is done with what is known as the input-process-output-store (IPOS) procedure. Under this technique, a system receives an input, processes the command, gives the desired output, and either stores it or repeats the cycle once more (Parsons, 2017). Sometimes this process is intercepted hence why users will be given undesired outputs or their information is retrieved without their permission.</p>

<p> <b>Digital Data</b></p>

<p>The prevalence of information technology (IT) systems has led to a dramatic increase in personal information that is shared online over the last two decades. This is something commonly known as digital data. Information on computer systems is represented by on and off signals symbolized by zeros and ones (What is digital data?, 2019). Binary code is used to store this information which includes everything ranging from software code, images, and files on a system. Not only is this system used to process commands and inputs on a CPU, but it is also implemented for communication purposes. When information such as addresses, or birthdays are typed into a website, for example, this digital data is communicated between a network which raises many concerns in the cybersecurity realm. In order to boost the production and efficiency of such use and storage of digital data measures such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence have become more common (Cybersecurity: security risks and solutions in the digital transformation age, n.d.). Although there are benefits to this change there are also risks that come with the growing dependence on networks and the digitization of human life. Part of this unease comes from the gap between awareness of security and the occurrence of cyberattacks (Cybersecurity: security risks and solutions in the digital transformation age, n.d.). Currently, 97% of organizations that have been reviewed in 63 nations have had a breach (Matthews, 2016), and considering the measures that are available and what is known, that is dangerous.</p>

<p>The 21st century is greatly transforming the role that technology plays in daily life. Initially, computers were used to increase the efficiency of completing math computations but now that responsibility has extended into simple tasks such as running and going grocery shopping. Many do not realize that the information collected by information systems about doing such tasks can pose a threat to users. If someone with malicious intent gains access to where someone runs every day or their shopping habits by gaining unauthorized access to their cloud then not only has a cybercrime taken place but that persons livelihood may be at risk. In order to reduce these kinds of occurrences, because hackers get more and more creative especially the more we protect ourselves, the way that cybersecurity is considered needs to be re-strategized and mature continuously (Cybersecurity: security risks and solutions in the digital transformation age, n.d.). Organizations need to consider how the continuous integration of IT systems into business infrastructure means having a modern approach to business affairs. Traditional measures such as firewalls are no longer substantial enough to prevent hackers or spyware hence why there needs a better consideration of how to protect the infrastructure in place and data protection (Kamis, 2019).</p>

<br>
<p><b>Literature Review</b></p>

<p><b>Types of Cyber Security Threats</b></p>

<p>The use of computer systems necessitates connections to networks which leads to numerous cybersecurity threats which should be considered. Protection from these threats changes as measures are mastered and become inefficient, for this reason breaches become more common than desired.</p>

<p>One method a hacker can use to manipulate users' data is through social engineering which obtains private information by persuading the user to provide private information. This type of attack is most seen with spam emails, phone calls, or malicious advertising. Malware is another pathway that is executed to disable security protocols on a system that results in losing control of a device and its privacy. Malware is often infiltrated on a device after installing illegitimate software, downloading files or programs with viruses. Hacking is another very common way that users are taken advantage of in the digital world. Under these circumstances, the username and password are accessed often to gain financial information or harm a person&rsquo;s identity. This cyber-attack is closely associated with ransomware because hacking can also allow for unauthorized access to ports or private information which can lead to people being blackmailed (Svoboda &amp; Lukas, 2019). Some attacks, such as zero-day exploitations, take advantage of user vulnerability and their ignorance or inability to take advantage of security measures such as firewalls. Phishing also takes advantage of such vulnerabilities by seeing how susceptible users are to opening illegitimate messages and providing sensitive information (Cyber Attack - What Are Common Cyberthreats?, 2020).</p>

<p>Considering the reality of cyber threats, their occurrences, and the protective measures in place users need to adapt to the expanding and shifting methods used to take advantage of their vulnerabilities. It should be heavily emphasized that current methods are becoming increasingly ineffective and new techniques to ensure protection are needed.</p>

<p><b>Current Cyber Security Measures</b></p>

<p>Many practices are encouraged to foresee the protection of users' digital data and to reduce the ignorance of users&rsquo; so their vulnerabilities aren&rsquo;t exploited. Norton believes that users have a responsibility to protect their data by simply not sharing their data online or over the phone unless with legitimate or known recipients (Grace, n.d.). The issue with this outlook on data protection is that it doesn&rsquo;t keep in mind that man-in-the-middle attacks also take place over the phone. It is just as easy, if not easier, to intercept digital communications as it is to interfere with phone lines. The company also advises using strong passwords and password authentication (Grace, n.d.). This measure has become more and more effective due to the occurrence of dictionary attacks but more than often a password manager is used for this measure. These managers frequently use a cloud server to store this information for a user which proses more risks in the long run. Norton as well recommends the continuous use of secure websites and connections as a preventative measure (Grace, n.d.) but once again this guarantees nothing. More often than not advertising is an open market meaning that no matter how secure a site is what users click matters. Even in the circumstances of accessing a legitimate advertisement, there is also the risk of being redirected numerous times which means that others may get access to cookies without stakeholders' knowledge.</p>

<p>Although the aforementioned measures have downfalls some practices will forever be beneficial no matter how much the use and risks of IT systems use expands. By staying up to date on software update packages and backing up files, operating systems and web browsers are at a reduced risk thus reducing user weaknesses substantially. People should also stay informed and get training or continuously obtain knowledge on their responsibilities as an IT systems user (Grace, n.d.). There are many policies enacted by governments to ensure the safety of people and their information but often they are not followed hence why so many are taken advantage of.&#8239;&#8239;</p>

<p>The minimum of these measures must become a priority for all computer users. Many don&rsquo;t take cyber threats serious which is clear as the statistic for cyber-attacks has risen 34 percent as of 2016 (Kerner, 2017). A one-third increase in cyber-attacks is huge especially when the rate that people are increasingly using IT systems in daily life is rapid.</p>

<p><b>Future Implications</b></p>

<p>When the issues related to the use of information systems, such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence, aren&rsquo;t evaluated on a large scale long-term issues arise. One recent occurrence where the measures to reduce cybersecurity threats had to be reconsidered was the 2016 United States election. One issue that was heavily highlighted was how foreign leaders can use vulnerabilities of government officials to compromise emails and use it to their advantage (Robinson, 2016). This exposed that server weaknesses are present not only on the personal level of systems use but at a government level as well. During this election year certain candidates, Donald Trump also aimed to take advantage of these weaknesses by encouraging hacking to take place for personal advantages (Bradley, 2016). This even further showed not only government officials that cybersecurity measures need drastic improvements, but it also proved to the public that everyone is at risk in the digital world.</p>

<p>Following the status quo when examining cybersecurity threats is a key influence is the growing rate of data breaches. By changing the perspective that cyber threats and their source are viewed from the solutions and prevention methods can improve and become more effective. One way of making this improvement is by focusing more on the role that an individual user plays in securing the safety of their data (Kamis, 2019). By evaluating risks from a community stance, it makes it harder to identify the &ldquo;needle in the haystack&rdquo; which makes it easier for hackers because agencies are focused on the needs of the group and not the individuals. Considerations of the differences in behavior and intent mean that certain users can not only have higher priority but the measures implemented to see their privacy may be regulated heavier (Kamis, 2019). Not only should the new practices be more considerate of the needs of each user, but they should also evaluate the current needs of a system. Hackers are making their methods of accessing a system more complex and that same approach should be applied to the protection of the systems that people use. The improvements also shouldn&rsquo;t limit the freedoms that users have but rather simply enforce the safety of their data.</p>
