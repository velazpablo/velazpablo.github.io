<p style="text-align: center;">Abstract</p>
  <p>Information systems as a broad form of collecting and processing data can be an essential step in any health sector. Such systems can be extremely beneficial for patient's safety and reduce general costs and disease prevention. As many diseases create an imminent threat for societies regularly, we as humans develop ways to prevent such events from happening. This document will include the ways information systems are helping entire nations cure diseases and prevent them from happening in the future. Adapting older systems to new technologies plays an integral part in how induvial adapt to changes, also connected to this challenge; there is the cultural factor, which is also crucial to the acceptance process such modifications. Such discussions will be based on previous studies carried by organizations that have taken a closer look at how these information systems might help health institutions.</p>

  <p>Information Systems Role in Health Care</p>
  
  <p>In countries where technology is less accessible, many problems can arise when managing records containing patient's information. Such critical data can be essential when treating a patient for something like a recent injury. In some cases, new methods are carried out by an organization. Still, no proper training is provided, or the acquired system might not be suitable for the workflow or work environment (culture could be another factor). Early identification of the problems that cause a malfunction of the workflow can be beneficial for the general patient's outcome.</p>

  <p>Many factors also play an essential role in this study, in third world countries developing, deploying, and testing such systems may be difficult due to electricity outages, and unreliable and expensive internet connection. This issue could vary from country to country and also depends on the regions the research is established. Nonetheless, testing these methods can bring useful data for systems created. According to Barata et al. (2018), to adapt to such systems, five essential elements need to be taken into account: context, process, people, IT, and data.</p>
  <hr class="my-4">
  <p>HMIS lack of organization</p>
  <p>As important as health management information systems (HMIS) is, the involvement of information technology (IT) has little to none relevance in an environment where local norms and values are deeply rooted. As shown in the research produced by Bernardi et al. (2019) which shows how IT can contribute to the deinstitutionalization by analyzing two vital sectors: IT affordances and human agency. </p>

  <p>In these pour countries, we can see how national ministries and international agencies promote the development and use of such HMIS to track extraordinary performance. Still, on the other hand, we can see how such systems are either never put in place or barely used. On most occasions, data is held on a national level; therefore, local healthcare providers are rarely able to access it. Due to the scarce resources in most low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), it is often hard for healthcare managers and workers to achieve healthcare performance targets instructed by national ministries. According to Bernardi et al. (2019), failing to do so brings the consequences of being transferred or even fired. Such measures outcome is for workers to develop workarounds, which often lead to misinformation or non-reporting.</p>
  <hr class="my-4">
  <p>IT implementation</p>
  <p>Even though the use of IS and IT systems can have a positive effect on patient's healthcare, such implementation varies between medical specialties, types of organizations, and countries. One critical study that reflects how IT and IS systems was developed by Son et al. (2019) which showed how the implementation of IT and IS systems are a great resource to health data for patients with chronic asthma. Asthma is one of the most widespread chronic diseases, totaling approximately 24.6 million people in the United States, and totaling $81.9 billion in patient cost related to such condition. </p>

  <p>There is a diverse asthma management HIS already in place, from electronic action plans to smartphone applications and web-based dashboards. These are essential for the data that becomes available to healthcare workers, but at the same time, they not as useful since the data needs to be reported by the patients themselves. According to Son el al. (2019), this data could have issues as human input errors and an excessive amount of missing observations. The study developed by Son called the smart asthma management (SAM) system uses a remote patient technology. This newly developed system is equipped with a Bluetooth sensor that is attached to the personal inhalers, which records the date and time the inhaler was used, but also temperature and air pollution levels. By using such technology, human error is eliminated, and at the same time, there is no longer the need to rely on patients inputting the information. This study plays an abundant source of knowledge, and it shows how the implementation of these IT systems in correlation with IS can prove to be beneficial to patients in almost all ranges in the medical field. </p>
  <hr class="my-4">
  <p>As many information systems play a successful role around the world within organizations like WHO, we also need the acknowledgment that some of these systems are not correctly setup, especially in LMIC. Counties with fewer resources are vulnerable to healthcare issues, but recent events have proven society; this is only an assumption. With a widespread pandemic like the COVID-19, HIMS is crucial to informing on health issues that arise in other nations. These systems could potentially alert the world in case a virus like this reappears in the future. </p>
